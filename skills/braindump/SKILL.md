# rkit:braindump

Parse unstructured input into organized action items using the team's management framework.

## Current State

- Config: !`if [ -f "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" ] && jq empty "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" 2>/dev/null; then echo "EXISTS"; jq '{token_masked: (.api_token[:3] + "..." + .api_token[-4:]), default_team_id, api_base}' "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json"; else echo "MISSING — run /rkit:setup"; fi`
- Today: !`date +%Y-%m-%d`

## Rules

- **Interpret first, act second.** Read the user's pasted text. Parse it. Present the table. Ask only when truly ambiguous.
- **Confirm writes.** GET requests execute immediately. POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE: describe the action and ask for confirmation first.
- **Show IDs.** Always include entity IDs in output.
- **Concise output.** Tables and short summaries. No filler.
- **Direct execution.** Use Bash with api.sh for all API calls. Never use Task agents.
- **Framework-aware.** Use the team's framework terminology (EOS, OKR, 4DX, V2MOM, SRT) when labeling items.

## Core Principles

1. **Handle partial information gracefully** — Full context is ideal but not required. Infer what you can, ask only when truly ambiguous.

2. **Minimize interactions while remaining intelligent** — Default to sensible assumptions. The goal is an experience that feels magical, not one that interrogates the user.

3. **The line between "magical" and "stupid"** — Smart inference without wrong assumptions. When uncertain, ask; when reasonably confident, proceed.

## Object Model

See `references/eos-object-model.md` for full definitions. Summary:

| Type | Definition | Default Destination |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Action Item | General task | Personal Prioritizer |
| To-do | Action item on L10 or 1:1 (7-day due) | L10/1:1 + others |
| Issue | Blocked/stuck item or identified problem | Same as above |
| Project | Collection of action items | (container) |
| Rock | 90-day target | (reference only) |
| Milestone | Sub-component of rock/project | (reference only) |

## Output Format

Always output a markdown table with these columns:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Item | Descriptive name (may include ticket IDs like SUP-XXX, RSW-XXXXX) |
| Description | Verbatim source text in quotes, prefaced with source type (e.g., "from pasted email:", "from dictation:") |
| Organize as a | To-do, Action Item, Issue, Project |
| Status | Done, Not Done |
| Context | Destination(s): Personal Prioritizer, L10, 1:1, Project name |
| Owner | Person responsible |
| Created at | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Due by | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |

## Issue Handling

When an Issue is identified:

1. Create the Issue row with description appended: "— to-do logged for {person} to {resolve | investigate and provide a timeline}"

2. Create a corresponding To-do row:
   - Item: "{ticket ID if exists} {investigate | resolve} {issue summary}"
   - Description: "To resolve the issue '{issue name}' by {owner} on {created date}"
   - Owner: Same as Issue owner unless explicitly stated otherwise

## Default Behaviors

Apply these defaults to minimize questions:

| Situation | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| L10 or 1:1 context | 7-day due date |
| Owner not stated | Person who surfaced the item |
| Created at not clear | Today's date |
| Issues | Auto-generate corresponding To-do |
| No context specified | Personal Prioritizer |
| "Me" as owner | Acceptable; use as-is |

## When to Ask

Only ask when:

- **Owner** is genuinely unclear (e.g., "your Robert" in someone else's email)
- **Context** cannot be reasonably inferred and would affect due dates
- **Completed items** appear — confirm include or filter out
- **Potential duplicates** — confirm if items are same or distinct
- **Dates** not derivable from source and due date matters

## Parsing Guidelines

1. **Item names**: Create descriptive names, not just ticket IDs. Example: "SUP-946 fix incorrect last login date" not just "SUP-946"

2. **Split compound items**: "Update OIT and Mender scorecards" → two separate rows

3. **Preserve verbatim text**: Put original text in Description column in quotes

4. **Infer action verbs**: Add appropriate verbs when missing. "Accuracy data from MAHA" → "Get accuracy data from MAHA"

5. **Source attribution**: Always prefix Description with source type:
   - "from pasted email:"
   - "from dictation:"
   - "from meeting notes:"
   - "from chat:"

## Example Interaction Flow

**User pastes unstructured text** → Parse into table → Ask minimal clarifying questions → Update table with answers → Done

Batch questions together. Allow user to answer multiple questions in one response.

Example questions:
- "Owner: These appear to be Gus's items—confirm? Exception: item X mentions 'Robert'—is Robert the owner?"
- "Completed items: Include SUP-909 and SUP-347 as Done, or filter out?"
- "Context: Do any of these belong to an L10 or 1:1, or all Personal Prioritizer?"
