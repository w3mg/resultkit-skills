name: rkit:meetings
description: Build and refresh a local "ResultMaps Team and Project IDs" reference doc by interactively asking which teams/orgs the user works with, then fetching each team's projects and one-on-one meetings via the ResultMaps V2 API. Use this skill whenever the user wants to seed or refresh their team/project/1:1 ID catalog, mentions running it after /rkit:setup, or asks anything like "list my teams and 1:1s", "build my meetings doc", "refresh team IDs", "catalog my 1:1s by team", "update my IDs reference", or anything else that requires a consolidated reference of team IDs, project IDs, and 1:1 IDs across multiple orgs. Trigger this skill liberally — users won't always say "rkit:meetings" but will describe what they want.

# rkit:meetings

Builds and refreshes a single local markdown file that catalogs the teams, projects, and 1:1 meetings you care about across orgs. The file is meant to be the stable reference Claude greps when you say things like "show me Mender's project board" or "open my 1:1 with Stacy" — so the IDs need to be accurate and the doc needs to be friendly to skim.

## Current State

- Config: !`if [ -f "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" ] && jq empty "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" 2>/dev/null; then jq -r '"OK — meetings_doc_path: " + (.meetings_doc_path // "(default)")' "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json"; else echo "MISSING — run /rkit:setup first"; fi`
- Doc target: !`jq -r '.meetings_doc_path // "/Users/scottilevy/Development/rk-chief-of-staff/ResultMaps Team and Project IDs.md"' "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "(default path)"`
- Doc state: !`DOC=$(jq -r '.meetings_doc_path // "/Users/scottilevy/Development/rk-chief-of-staff/ResultMaps Team and Project IDs.md"' "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" 2>/dev/null); if [ -f "$DOC" ]; then if grep -q '<!-- rkit:meetings:start -->' "$DOC" 2>/dev/null; then echo "EXISTS (with markers)"; else echo "EXISTS (no markers — confirm before overwrite)"; fi; else echo "NOT YET — first run will create"; fi`

## Rules

- **Read references before improvising.** [`references/doc-format.md`](references/doc-format.md) defines the exact markdown structure and marker fences. [`references/team-selection.md`](references/team-selection.md) defines the selection UX. Don't reinvent either.
- **Confirm writes.** Before writing the doc, show a one-line summary ("3 teams, 12 projects, 18 1:1s") and ask the user to confirm.
- **Preserve human edits.** Only the content between `<!-- rkit:meetings:start -->` and `<!-- rkit:meetings:end -->` is auto-managed. Anything outside the markers is the user's; never touch it.
- **Concise output.** Tables and short summaries. Don't echo raw API JSON to the user.
- **Default to the right action.** On refresh, default to "use the same teams as last time." Make the lazy path correct.

## Flow

### Step 1: Preflight

If `Current State → Config` shows MISSING, tell the user to run `/rkit:setup` first and stop.

Determine the doc path: `meetings_doc_path` from config, else default `/Users/scottilevy/Development/rk-chief-of-staff/ResultMaps Team and Project IDs.md`. If the parent directory doesn't exist, ask the user before creating it (`mkdir -p`).

### Step 2: Detect first-run vs refresh

Check whether the doc file exists.

- **First run** (no file): no defaults; jump to Step 3 with an empty pre-selection.
- **Refresh** (file exists): parse the Teams table inside the markers to get the currently-tracked team IDs. These become the default selection.

If the file exists but has no markers, ask before overwriting. Offer to wrap the existing auto-looking sections in markers if the user confirms.

### Step 3: Select teams

Follow [`references/team-selection.md`](references/team-selection.md). High-level:

1. Call `GET /teams?per_page=100` (paginate if `meta.total_pages > 1`).
2. **On refresh, ask first**: "Refresh with the current selection ({N} teams), or change which teams are tracked?" — Options: `Refresh same`, `Change selection`, `Cancel`. If `Refresh same`, skip to Step 4.
3. **Multi-select** the teams to track. Group teams visually under their parent org (indent children by 2 spaces). On refresh, pre-check the previous selection.

### Step 4: Fetch projects + 1:1s

For each selected team, in parallel:

- `GET /teams/{id}/projects?per_page=100` — projects
- `GET /1-on-1?group_id={id}&per_page=100` — 1:1s

If `meta.total_pages > 1`, paginate. If a team has zero projects or zero 1:1s, render `_None._` in the corresponding subsection — don't omit the heading.

While fetching, give one short status line per team ("Fetched Mender: 5 projects, 10 1:1s"). Don't dump the JSON.

### Step 5: Confirm + write

Build the assembled markdown per [`references/doc-format.md`](references/doc-format.md). Print a one-line summary and ask:

> About to write {N} teams, {M} projects, {K} 1:1s to `{path}`. Proceed?

On confirm:
- If the file exists with markers → replace only the content between markers (preserve everything outside).
- If the file exists without markers → user already confirmed in Step 2; do the agreed action.
- If the file doesn't exist → create it with the full template (header above markers, auto-managed block inside, empty space after markers for human notes).

### Step 6: Done

Print:
> Wrote `{path}` — {N} teams, {M} projects, {K} 1:1s. Last updated {YYYY-MM-DD}.

## Edge Cases

- **No teams selected** → confirm "Empty catalog — are you sure?" then exit without writing.
- **API failure mid-run** → don't write a partial doc. Tell the user which call failed and stop.
- **Doc path outside `$HOME`** → fine if `meetings_doc_path` is configured, but warn before creating new directories outside `$HOME`.
- **Team disappeared between runs** (was in old Teams table, no longer in `/teams` response) → drop it silently from the new doc; don't error. The user removed access; respect that.
- **`meetings_doc_path` set but unreachable** (e.g., external drive unmounted) → tell the user, offer to fall back to the default path for this run only.
