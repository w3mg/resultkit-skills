# rkit:teams

List teams, view team members, change member roles, and view activity logs.

## Current State

- Config: !`if [ -f "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" ] && jq empty "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json" 2>/dev/null; then echo "EXISTS"; jq '{token_masked: (.api_token[:3] + "..." + .api_token[-4:]), default_team_id, api_base}' "$HOME/.config/resultkit/config.json"; else echo "MISSING — run /rkit:setup"; fi`
- api.sh: !`echo "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/teams/scripts/api.sh}" | xargs -I{} sh -c '[ -f "{}" ] && echo "{}" && exit 0; for p in "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/"*/rkit/*/skills/teams/scripts/api.sh "$HOME/.claude/skills/rkit:teams/scripts/api.sh" "$HOME/.agents/skills/teams/scripts/api.sh" "$HOME/.gemini/skills/teams/scripts/api.sh" "scripts/api.sh"; do [ -f "$p" ] && echo "$p" && exit 0; done; echo "NOT_FOUND"'`

## Rules

- **Confirm writes.** Role change (PATCH), set logo (POST), and remove logo (DELETE) require confirmation before executing. Activity logs and all list operations are GET — no confirmation needed.
- **Show IDs.** Always include team, member, and user IDs in output.
- **Concise output.** Tables and short summaries. No filler.
- **Direct execution.** Use Bash with api.sh for all API calls. Never use Task agents.

## Argument Parsing

| Input | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| *(no args)* | List visible (non-muted) teams grouped by organization |
| `all` | Include muted teams in listing (muted teams marked) |
| `q "search term"` | Search teams by name (min 2 chars) |
| `all q "term"` | Search including muted teams |
| `members` | List members of the default team |
| `members {team_id}` | List members of the specified team |
| `role {user_id} {role} [team_id]` | Change a member's role (`admin` or `member`) on a team |
| `logs [team_id]` | View team activity logs (membership changes) |
| `logo set {url} [team_id]` | Set logo for a team (admin only) |
| `logo remove [team_id]` | Remove logo for a team (admin only) |
| `use {team_id}` | Set the server-side active team to the given team ID (requires confirmation) |

---

## Flow: List Teams

### Step 1: Resolve API path

- Default: `GET /teams` (excludes muted — server-side filtering confirmed)
- If `all` in args: `GET /teams?include_muted=true`
- If `q "term"` in args: add `q=term` param
- Combine as needed: `/teams?include_muted=true&q=term`

### Step 2: Fetch teams

```bash
API_SH="<api.sh path>"
RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" GET "/teams?PARAMS")
echo "$RESPONSE"
```

### Step 3: Handle response

Parse the JSON response from api.sh.

**Error responses** (status 0 or non-200):
- `"error": "NO_CONFIG"` or `"error": "NO_TOKEN"` → "Config not found. Run `/rkit:setup` first."
- `"error": "CURL_FAILED"` → "Network error. Check your connection."
- `status: 401` → "Unauthorized (401). Run `/rkit:setup` to update your token."
- Other non-200 → Show status code and error from response body.

**Success (status 200)**:

Extract the teams array from `body.data` (standard data envelope). Each element is a team object.

- **Empty array** (or no matches with `q`):
  - With search: "No teams matching '{term}'."
  - Without search: "No teams found."

- **Teams present**: Group by `organization_name` and display:

  ```
  ## Your Teams

  ### {organization_name}

  | ID | Name | Framework | Logo | |
  |----|------|-----------|------|-|
  | 345 | Engineering | eos | abc123handle | (default) |
  | 412 | Product | okr | — | |

  ### {another_org}

  | ID | Name | Framework | Logo | |
  |----|------|-----------|------|-|
  | 500 | Sales | srt | — | |

  {count} teams
  ```

  - `Framework` column: show value or "—" if null
  - `Logo` column: show the Filestack handle (last path segment of `logo_url`, e.g. `abc123handle`) or "—" if `logo_url` is null. Extract handle with `echo "$logo_url" | sed 's|.*/||'`
  - Mark the team matching `default_team_id` from config with `(default)`
  - If `all` was used, mark muted teams with `(muted)`
  - If only one organization, still show the org header
  - Show total count at the bottom

---

## Flow: List Members

### Step 1: Resolve team ID

- If a team ID is provided in args → use it
- Otherwise → use `default_team_id` from Current State config
- If neither available → "No team specified and no default configured. Run `/rkit:setup`."

### Step 2: Fetch members (all pages)

```bash
API_SH="<api.sh path>"
RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" GET "/teams/TEAM_ID/members?per_page=100")
echo "$RESPONSE"
```

Replace `TEAM_ID` with actual value.

### Step 3: Handle response

**Error responses** (status 0 or non-200):
- `"error": "NO_CONFIG"` or `"error": "NO_TOKEN"` → "Config not found. Run `/rkit:setup` first."
- `"error": "CURL_FAILED"` → "Network error. Check your connection."
- `status: 401` → "Unauthorized (401). Run `/rkit:setup` to update your token."
- `status: 404` → "Team {id} not found (404)."
- Other non-200 → Show status code and error from response body.

**Success (status 200)**:

Extract `body.data` array (members) and `body.meta` (pagination).

- **Empty data array**: "No members found for team {id}."

- **Members present**: Display as table:

  ```
  ## Members — Team {team_name} ({team_id})

  | Name | Role | User ID |
  |------|------|---------|
  | Jane Doe | admin | 101 |
  | John Smith | member | 205 |

  {count} members
  ```

  - `Name` column: `user.first_name` + `user.last_name`. If both empty, fall back to `user.login`.
  - `Role` column: `role` value (admin/member)
  - `User ID` column: `user.id`

- **Pagination**: If `meta.total_pages > 1`, fetch all remaining pages and combine results before displaying.

## Flow: Change Member Role

Triggered by: `role {user_id} {role} [team_id]`

### Step 1: Validate args

- Extract `user_id` and `role` from args (both required).
- If either missing: "Usage: `/rkit:teams role {user_id} {role} [team_id]`\n  Example: `/rkit:teams role 42 admin`" — stop.
- If `role` is not `admin` or `member`: "Invalid role '{role}'. Use 'admin' or 'member'." — stop.
- Resolve team ID: use provided `team_id` arg if present, else `default_team_id` from config. If neither: "No team specified and no default configured. Run `/rkit:setup`." — stop.

### Step 2: Fetch current member info

```bash
API_SH="<api.sh path>"
RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" GET "/teams/TEAM_ID/members?per_page=100")
```

Find the member with `user.id == user_id` in the `body.data` array.

- If 401: "Unauthorized (401). Run `/rkit:setup` to update your token." — stop.
- If 403: "Access denied (403). Only team admins can change roles." — stop.
- If 404: "Team TEAM_ID not found (404)." — stop.
- If member not found in data: "User USER_ID is not a member of team TEAM_ID." — stop.

### Step 3: Confirm

Show the member's current state and proposed change, then ask for confirmation:

```
Change Jane Doe (ID: 42) from member to admin on team #345?
```

Use AskUserQuestion with Yes/No options. If user declines: "Role change cancelled." — stop.

### Step 4: Execute role change

```bash
RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" PATCH "/teams/TEAM_ID/members/USER_ID" '{"role":"ROLE"}')
```

### Step 5: Handle response

- If 401: "Unauthorized (401). Run `/rkit:setup` to update your token."
- If 403: "Access denied (403). Only team admins can change roles."
- If 404: "Team or member not found (404)."
- If 422: Show validation error from response body.
- If 200: Display result:

  ```
  Changed role: Jane Doe (ID: 42) is now admin on team #345.
  ```

  Display user name (`first_name last_name`, fallback to `login`), user ID, new role, and team ID.

### Step 1: Resolve team ID and URL

- Extract URL arg (required). If missing: "Usage: `/rkit:teams logo set {url} [team_id]`\n  URL must be a Filestack CDN URL (https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/...)." — stop.
- If `team_id` provided in args → use it; else use `default_team_id` from config. If neither: "No team specified and no default configured. Run `/rkit:setup`." — stop.

### Step 2: Fetch team name for confirmation

```bash
API_SH="<api.sh path>"
TEAM_RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" GET "/teams/TEAM_ID")
```

- If 404: "Team TEAM_ID not found (404)." — stop.
- Extract `body.data.name` for display in confirmation.

### Step 3: Confirm

Show the proposed action and ask for confirmation:

```
Set logo for team #345 (Engineering) to: https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/abc123handle?
```

Use AskUserQuestion with Yes/No options. If user declines: "Logo set cancelled." — stop.

### Step 4: Execute

```bash
RESPONSE=$("$API_SH" POST "/teams/TEAM_ID/logo" '{"logo_url":"URL"}')
```

### Step 5: Handle response

- If 200: Display result:
  ```

## Edge Cases

- **No config**: "Config not found. Run `/rkit:setup` first."
- **api.sh not found**: "api.sh not found. Install via: `/plugin marketplace add w3mg/resultkit-skills` then `/plugin install rkit@resultkit`"
- **Search term < 2 chars**: "Search requires at least 2 characters."
- **No teams match search**: "No teams matching '{term}'."
- **Team not found (404) on members**: "Team {id} not found (404)."
- **No members**: "No members found for team {id}."
- **Member with empty names**: Fall back to `login`.
- **Role change — missing args**: Show usage message.
- **Role change — invalid role**: "Invalid role '{role}'. Use 'admin' or 'member'."
- **Role change — user not a member**: "User {id} is not a member of team {team_id}."
- **Role change — not admin (403)**: "Access denied (403). Only team admins can change roles."
- **Role change — user changes own role**: API decides; show its response.
- **Set logo — missing URL arg**: Show usage message with Filestack URL requirement.
- **Set logo — non-Filestack URL (422)**: "Invalid URL (422). Logo URL must start with `https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/`."
