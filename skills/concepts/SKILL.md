  ResultMaps product and domain concept reference. Use this skill whenever someone asks what ResultMaps is,
  what a business concept means in the product (rock, objective, WIG, measurable, scorecard, seat, vision,
  mission, result area, key result, milestone, item, issue, to-do, day plan, assignment, group, team, account),
  how management frameworks differ (EOS, OKR, 4DX, V2MOM, SRT, SVEP), what terminology maps to what,
  or needs general orientation on the product domain. Also use when someone says "explain concept",
  "domain overview", "product overview", "what does X mean", "EOS vs OKR", or "framework terminology".
  This is a conceptual reference — no code, no implementation details.

# ResultMaps Concepts

ResultMaps is a business operating system for team alignment. It helps organizations set direction, track execution, and run meetings — all adapted to whichever management framework the team uses.

## What ResultMaps Does

Organizations use ResultMaps to:
- Define where they're going (Vision, Mission, Values)
- Set quarterly and annual goals
- Break goals into actionable work
- Track progress with scorecards and measures
- Run structured weekly meetings
- Manage accountability through roles and seats

---

## Organizational Structure

### Account
The tenant boundary. One company = one account. Everything lives inside an account: users, teams, goals, items, measures.

### Group (Team)
The organizational unit. Groups form a hierarchy — a company has a root group, with child teams beneath it, and sub-teams beneath those. This tree structure means a department can contain multiple teams, each with their own goals and meetings.

### User
A person in the system. Users belong to one or more groups through memberships. A user can be a member of multiple teams simultaneously.

### Seat
A role on the accountability chart — think "VP of Sales" or "Marketing Lead," not the person filling it. A user is *assigned to* a seat. This separates the role from the person, so when someone leaves, the seat (and its accountabilities) stays. Seats are especially prominent in EOS, where rocks are tracked by seat.

### Group Membership
The link between a user and a group. A user can have different membership types across different groups.

---

## Strategic Planning Hierarchy

ResultMaps organizes strategic thinking in a top-down cascade:

```
Vision
  └── Mission
       └── Result Area
            └── Goal
                 ├── Key Result / Milestone
                 └── Item (actionable work)
                      └── Item (sub-task)
```

### Vision
Where the organization is headed. Can be personal (an individual's life direction) or team-level (the company's future state). Includes a description and a purpose ("why it matters"). EOS teams use the Vision/Traction Organizer (VTO) which adds core values, BHAG, and marketing strategy.

### Mission
How the organization achieves its vision. A group can have multiple missions. Missions contain result areas.

### Result Area
A focus area within a mission — the broad categories of work that matter. In EOS these are called "Annual Goals" or "1-Year Goals." In SRT they're called "Must Win Battles."

### Goal
A time-bound objective, typically quarterly (90 days). This is the core planning object. What it's *called* depends on the framework:

| Framework | Goal is called |
|-----------|---------------|
| OKR | Objective |
| EOS | Rock |
| 4DX | WIG (Wildly Important Goal) |
| V2MOM | Method |
| SRT | Must Win Battle |

Goals belong to either a user or a group (this is the "achievable" relationship — a goal is *achievable by* someone or some team).

### Key Result / Milestone
The measurable outcome beneath a goal. Proves whether the goal is on track or complete.

| Framework | Outcome is called |
|-----------|------------------|
| OKR | Key Result |
| EOS | Milestone |
| 4DX | Lead Measure |
| V2MOM | Measure |
| SRT | Result |

### Item
Actionable work — a task, to-do, or issue. Items form their own hierarchy (parent/child), so a large task can be broken into sub-tasks. Items can be aligned to goals, meaning "this work supports that objective."

---

## Object Types and Priority

Items aren't all equal. ResultMaps distinguishes several types, each carrying a different priority signal:

### Action Item
A general task. The base unit of work. Default destination is the personal prioritizer (day plan). Flexible due dates.

### To-Do
An action item that was *committed* in a meeting (L10 or 1:1). The act of committing elevates its priority. When created in a meeting context, it gets a 7-day due date from the meeting date.

### Issue
Something stuck, blocked, or newly identified as a problem. Issues always generate a corresponding to-do for resolution. They carry elevated priority because they need active attention.

### Project
A collection of related action items. A container, not a task itself. Projects that support a rock/objective carry higher priority.

### Rock
A 90-day target (EOS terminology). Not created as an item — rocks are goals. But knowing that an item supports a rock increases that item's priority weighting.

### Milestone
A sub-component of a rock or project. Like rocks, knowing an item supports a milestone boosts its priority.

### Priority Hierarchy (highest to lowest)
1. Supports a rock or milestone
2. Issue (needs resolution)
3. To-do (committed in meeting)
4. Action Item (base level)

---

## Contexts and Destinations

Items can exist in multiple contexts simultaneously:

| Context | Description | Due Date Rule |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Personal Prioritizer | Default home for all items; also called "Day Plan" | Flexible |
| L10 Meeting | Weekly tactical meeting (EOS Level 10) | 7 days from meeting |
| 1:1 Meeting | One-on-one meeting | 7 days (default, can override) |
| Project | Container for related action items | Inherited from project timeline |

---

## Planning and Execution

### Day Plan
A user's daily work plan. Contains day plan actions — the specific items they intend to work on that day, with estimated time, reported time, completion status, and the ability to defer to another date.

### Week Plan
A broader view — what a user plans to accomplish during the week.

### Assignment
A delegation. When someone assigns a goal or item to another user, it creates an assignment with a workflow status and notes. The assignment tracks who created it, who it's assigned to, and its current state.

---

## Scorecard and Measures

### Measure (Measurable)
A recurring metric tracked on the scorecard. Has a target value, a unit, and a data source. Measures belong to a group and can be linked to a seat and a user. EOS calls these "measurables."

### Measure Value
A single data point — one week's (or period's) recorded value for a measure.

### Rollup Measure
A measure that aggregates child measures. For example, a company-level "Total Revenue" that sums each team's revenue measure.

### Scorecard (Scoreboard)
The dashboard showing all measures for a team over time. EOS calls it a "scorecard," OKR calls it a "scoreboard."

---

## Meetings

ResultMaps supports structured recurring meetings. The name and format vary by framework:

| Framework | Weekly Meeting Name |
|-----------|-------------------|
| OKR | Weekly Sync |
| EOS | Weekly L10 (Level 10) |
| 4DX | Weekly Sync |
| V2MOM | Weekly Sync |
| SRT | Team Priorities |
| SVEP | Weekly Tactical |

### Meeting Sections
Weekly meetings typically include:
- **Wins / Segue** — good news and personal highlights (EOS calls this "Segue" or "Good News," others call it "Wins")
- **Scorecard review** — check the numbers
- **Rock/Objective review** — are quarterly goals on track?
- **To-Do review** — check last week's commitments
- **Issues (IDS)** — Identify, Discuss, Solve (EOS terminology). All frameworks track issues and challenges
- **Headlines** — notable updates for the team

### 1:1 Meeting
A one-on-one between two people (typically manager and direct report). Creates to-dos with 7-day due dates.

---

## Business Plans

Teams can define multi-horizon plans:
- **3-Year Picture** — long-range targets (EOS/OKR). Includes revenue, profit, and descriptive goals.
- **1-Year Plan** — annual targets
- **Quarterly Plans** (Q1–Q4) — each with description, target date, revenue, profit, and measurables

---
